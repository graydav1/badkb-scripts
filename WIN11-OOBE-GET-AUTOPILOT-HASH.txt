REM This script retrieves a device hash from a Windows machine that has had a clean Windows 11 installation done.
REM Here's how to use this:
REM 0. Edit this script. You'll want to set the GroupTag parameter, and possibly change the drive letter where the file is outputted if you have a DVD drive in the machine or something else that means D: isn't the USB stick.
REM 1. Create a Windows 11 installation USB using the media creation tool
REM 2. Install Windows 11 (see the WIN11-INSTALL.txt BadKB script if you want to automate that too)
REM 3. When the computer reboots to the OOBE screen, run this script
REM 4. It will press Shift+F10 to bring up a command prompt, then run all of this. Make sure that the USB stick is still plugged in and the drive is D:
REM If the command prompt isn't the active window, cancel the script and run it again so that the command prompt is the active window

REM 100ms delay between button presses by default
DEFAULTDELAY 100

REM Open Command Prompt
SHIFT F10

REM For some reason, command prompt isn't focused when you open it, so we alt-double-tab to make it active
HOLD ALT
TAB
DELAY 100
TAB
RELEASE ALT
DELAY 1000

REM Next, we make and CD into the powershell scripts folder. We do this to make sure that the script actually runs
STRINGLN mkdir "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts" & cd /D "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts"

REM Next we run the powershell script. The following command does several things:
REM 1. Check for an internet connection (and halt until it's available)
REM 2. Sets the timezone.
REM 3. Installs NuGet as a package provider. This is where the Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo script is hosted
REM 4. Installs the Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo script
REM 5. Run the Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo command and outputs it to autopilot_temp.csv (and sets the group tag to StudentLoanPATTesting)
REM 6. Converts the file into ASCII. If we don't do this, Excel just sees it as a .txt file and Intune tells us the file is formatted incorrectly.
REM 7. Shuts down after 60 seconds once hash is grabbed.
